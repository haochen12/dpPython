LAST MARCH, TWITTER CEO Jack Dorsey admitted that, despite the company¡¯s intentions, Twitter wasn¡¯t the best at encouraging productive or meaningful conversations among users. More often, the platform served to further abuse, harassment, and the spread of misinformation, while plunging users deeper into echo chambers. The solution, Dorsey said, was to shift from banning the most egregious offenders¡ªa task that many would argue Twitter hadn¡¯t excelled at¡ªand toward promoting ¡°conversational health.¡±

A year later, little has changed. Twitter is still a largely toxic place riddled with extremists, sock-puppet armies, and fake accounts; and the company¡¯s top brass is still talking about conversational health. Its most recent attempt to improve discourse on the platform was confirmed last week: a feature that would allow users to selectively hide replies to their tweets from public view, so that other users can¡¯t see the offending reply when interacting with the initial tweet.

First uncovered by Jane Manchun Wong, a software engineer known for discovering yet-to-be-announced features being tested by social media companies like Twitter and Facebook, the new feature allows others to view hidden replies through a menu option.
